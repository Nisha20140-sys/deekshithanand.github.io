              Hi there! I am currently a final year undergrad student pursuing Computer
               Science and Engineering at the National Institute of Engineering , Mysuru.
               I love solving challenges using modern day technological advancements.I love to code in  
               python and I am sufficiently good with C++. I am an avid reader of digital texts on platform like 
               quora. I prefer to be a life-long learner , well you know learning never ends! My interest lies in 
               E-governance , making technolgy and related resources easily accesible and problem-solving in general.
               I am pretty curios in how the machine like Computer learns and implements like we humans do !!!
